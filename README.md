# django_movies_api
_API homework for movie ratings_

**Objective: Create a RESTful API that you can perform CRUD actions on basic django models.**

Revisit your previous Django Movies assignment and adapt the existing project to include API views to serve your Movie, User, and Rating models through API views.

For all resources you are required to provide the URL endpoints:

- List all models for a given resource localhost:8000/api/:resource_name/
- Retrieve a specific instance for a given resource (by pk) localhost:8000/api/:resource_name/:pk/
- Create a Movie model through a POST request to the localhost:8000/api/:resource_name/ url
- Create a Review and Rater model through a POST request.
- Update existing fields on an existing movie, review, and rater resources.
- Delete an existing movie, review, and rater.

Required verbs to implement:
- GET
- POST
- PUT
- DELETE

To complete this assignment, I chose to use Python and the Django REST framework.
